🎮 Gameplay

Choose Player vs Player or Player vs AI.

Click any cell to make your move.

The AI responds intelligently in single-player mode.

The game checks for a win or draw after every turn.

Winning cells are highlighted with animations and a sound plays.

Try to win if possible

Pick a random available cell otherwise

This ensures a fair yet challenging opponent.
