## 3. How It Works

- The game board is an array of length 9: `["", "", ..., ""]`  
- Each cell is represented by a `.cell` in HTML with a `data-index`  
- When a player clicks on a cell:
  - JS checks if that cell is empty and the game is not over  
  - It updates the board array, re-renders the board, and checks for winner  
  - If a winner is found, it highlights the winning cells and shows a message  
  - If no empty cells remain and no winner, itâ€™s a draw  
- Reset button clears the board, resets game state, and allows a new match  
- The winning combination (if any) is found by checking all possible triplets
